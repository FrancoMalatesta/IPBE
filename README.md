The IPBE program calculates the thermodynamic properties of electrolyte solutions using a numerical solution to the complete Poisson-Boltzmann equation.

The IPBE software models the behavior of electrolytes by computing theoretical activity coefficients, osmotic coefficients, molar volumes, and enthalpies using a physically consistent approach based on the Poisson-Boltzmann equation. It extends traditional Debye-HÃ¼ckel theory by numerically solving the complete equation, providing accurate predictions, including for high-charge systems and complex mixtures. User input is handled through a guided textual interface for defining solute properties and conditions, enabling precise thermodynamic computations.
